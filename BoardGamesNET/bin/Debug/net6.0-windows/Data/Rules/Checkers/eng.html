        <h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>

        <h3 id="goal">Objective</h3>
        The objective of the game is to leave the opponent with only one piece.

        <h3 id="howitworks">How It Works</h3>

        <h4 id="preparation">Preparation</h4>
        The pieces are placed on the dark cells, on the first three rows starting from the bottom.

        <h4 id="procedure">Procedure</h4>
        <h5 id="procedure-1">Basic Movements</h5>
        <p>
            Players take turns starting with white.<br/>
            The current player chooses a piece and moves it forward and diagonally, i.e., moves it to one of the diagonally adjacent empty cells.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the selected cell is occupied by the player's own piece, the move is considered invalid.<br/> 
            However, if the chosen cell is occupied by an opponent's piece and the next adjacent cell is empty, the player has the right to proceed with the move, executing a 'capture' scenario.<br/>
            During this procedure, the player's piece will be moved beyond the adjacent opponent's piece, thus resulting in the removal of the latter from the game board.
        </p>

        <h5 id="procedure-2">Capture Obligation</h5>
        <p>
            If during their turn a player has the possibility to capture an opponent's piece, they are obliged to make the capture.<br/>
            In other words, if a piece is able to move to capture an opponent's piece, the player must execute the capture move.<br/>
            This rule is binding and cannot be ignored.<br/>
            However, if there are multiple capture options available, the player can choose which capture to make.
        </p>

        <h5 id="procedure-3">Continuation of Capture</h5>
        <p>
            If, after completing a capture move, the player's piece has an immediate possibility to capture another opponent's piece, then the player is obliged to continue the sequence of captures.<br/>
            In other words, if a piece has the opportunity to execute a series of consecutive captures, the player must proceed with such moves until there is no longer the possibility to make further captures.<br/>
            This rule is binding and must be adhered to during the turn of the player executing the captures.    
        </p>

        <h5 id="procedure-4">Promotion to King</h5>
        <p>
            When a piece reaches the last row of the opponent's field, it is promoted to a "king".<br/>
            The king has the ability to move both forward and backward along the diagonals.<br/>
            However, a king cannot continue a series of captures after being promoted.<br/>
            Additionally, a king cannot be captured by an opponent's piece, unless the opponent's piece is also a king.
